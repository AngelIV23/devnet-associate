MAC Addresses:

- Layer two identifiers
- 12 hexadecimals
- OUI and Unique identifiers 
- Sending frames 

Switches and Frames:
- Used by switches to determine where hosts reside on the switch
- When a host sends a frame, the switch broadcasts this out of all ports, except the one that it originated
- Since the switch broadcasts everytime a packet is sent, VLANs are needed to break the single "broadcast" domain


VLAN:
Overall VLANs are needed for the following reasons:
- Security is another reason to implement VLANs, we wouldn't want certain departments having access to things like all employees pay or company strategies
- Voice and Data should be separate VLANs
- Separation and different treatment of traffic
For example:
- VOIP and Video need to have the highest priority after routing and routing protocols, otherwise choppy audio, dropped calls, among many other issues will occur
- Breaks the broadcast domain
- Layer 2 feature
